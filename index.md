Lab Report 4

For the lab report this week, reproduce the task from the competition on your own. For each numbered step starting right after the timer (so steps 4-9), take a screenshot, and write down exactly which keys you pressed to get to that step. For special characters like <enter> or <tab>, write them in angle brackets with code formatting. Then, summarize the commands you ran and what the effect of those keypresses were.
